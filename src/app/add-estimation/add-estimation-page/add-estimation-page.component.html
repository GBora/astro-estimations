    <p><strong>Task</strong>: major task needed to implement the project, for example the front end work would be a task, the back-end work another,
       testing and deployment would also be best represented as their own tasks. Feel free to add multiple tasks if you consider them necesary.
       If you see tasks that you yourself have not defined, they have been added by your co-workers they are shown to you as they may be relevant
        to your estimation but please do not edit them.</p>
    <p><strong>Subtask</strong>: major tasks are then divided into subtasks which represent more granular elements of the implementation for example
     theming for the css or unit tests for the code. The total hours needed for a task is autmoatically calculated by adding up the estimations of 
     it's subtasks.</p>
    <p><strong>Possible subtask</strong>: If you are not sure a subtask will be needed, for example if you are not sure if extra time has to be alloted to 
    making the css responsive or deal with older brwosers, add the subtask with a title in the form of <em>"css might need to be written to handle small 
    screen devices"</em> estimate it and tick the Is Possible checkbox, the subtask will be counted separate from the normal tasks which are sure to be
    needed but will still show up in the estmation.</p>
    <p><strong>Question</strong>: feel free to attach any questions you'd like to ask to the estimation and they will be seen by the person who asked for
    the estimation.</p>
